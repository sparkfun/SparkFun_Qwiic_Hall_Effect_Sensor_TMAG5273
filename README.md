Do you have a project that could use an inconspicuous [HID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device) (human interface device)? Ever wanted to tamper-proof your window alarm (i.e. contact sensors) from teenagers sneaking out or home intruders? Do you have a mechanical switch that keeps failing?

If you answered yes to any of those questions, the TMAG5273 from [Texas Instruments](https://www.ti.com) could be the solution to your problems. The TMAG5273 is low-power 3D [hall-effect sensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor) that is perfect for detecting and measuring changes in a nearby magnetic field. With a linear, magnetic range configurable to either ±40 mT or ±80 mT and TI's integrated angle calculation engine (CORDIC), the TMAG5273 can be used in various applications:

* Detecting motor movement
* Creating a [HID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_interface_device) (human interface device) *(i.e. joysticks, knobs, scroll wheels, etc.)*
* Replacing various mechanical switches (i.e. rotary encoders, contact switches, reed switches, etc.)*

In addition, the included magnetic tamper detection and wake-up/threshold settings can be configured to trigger interrupts through the I<sup>2</sup>C interface or only with the dedicated interrupt pin.

*These products are available in both the standard 1"x1" and mini Qwiic breakout boards. The mini is panel mount compatible for use in enclosures.*
